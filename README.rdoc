Project days is a few days where students and teachers can all teach each
other anything.  This app organizes the creation of project listings, signing
up for interests, scheduling leaders and participants, generating schedule
listings and reports, etc.

It is quite specific to the way Project Days runs at one particular school,
but could be generalized to other similar scheduling tasks with some effort.
If you're interested in using/extending it, feel free to contact me.
