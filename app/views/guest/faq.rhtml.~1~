<h1>Project Day FAQs</h1>

<p><strong>“Owning” vs “Leading” a project:</strong> On project days
itself there is no difference.  The differences lie in the planning
stage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owning</strong> means you have the know-how and will organize the
materials.  You are my point person if I have questions about the
project.  If a project isn't “owned” it won't be offered.</li>
<li><strong>Leading</strong> means that you can run the project with a group of kids – Often I have projects like egg drop or bagel making that can run on many sessions. For those I need a variety of leaders or the adults get bored.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project list for each year will be the list of projects that
are owned by someone, but extra sessions are often called for.</p>

<p><strong>How do two people sign up to co-own a session?</strong> One
person logs in and creates the project page – that person can identify
co-owners when they create the project.</p>
	  
<p><strong>How long are the sessions?</strong> All projects will be
one hour and fifteen minute sessions.<br />
<strong>What if I need more time?</strong> You can get more time by
doing two/three sessions with the same kids.  Just note that in the
description.</p>

<p><strong>I don't have any ideas of what to do...  Projects from many
years are on the web page and posted in the staff room.  Good projects
are like good books you can repeat them again and again.  For example, I always need people for egg drop.  <em>Keep it simple.</em></p>

<p><strong>What about student leaders?</strong> Unit students and
young alumni are welcome to lead projects.  They will be assigned an
adult assistant to be present during their sessions.</p>

<p><strong>When I know my Schedule –</strong> <br />
<strong>In terms of time commitment:</strong> If you are an FSS
teacher plan on participating in all six sessions, if you are a
community volunteer plan on being scheduled according to the
availability you put into the web site.<br />
<strong>What will I do during those times?</strong> The large puzzle
of who does what when takes a solid two weeks to work out.  The
schedule is usually finalized during Memorial Day weekend.</p>
